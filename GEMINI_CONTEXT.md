# Context for Gemini Agent - Stage 1 Verification

## Current Status
Stage 1 for Agent D (DevOps MCP) is **COMPLETE**. All requirements have been implemented and validated.

## Key Facts You Need to Know

### 1. Working Directory
- You are currently in: `/Users/verlyn13/Development/personal/devops-mcp`
- This IS the Agent D (DevOps MCP) repository
- You do NOT need to access any other directories

### 2. Server Status
- The MCP server is ALREADY RUNNING on port 4319
- It has an HTTP bridge enabled for API access
- Bearer token: `devops-mcp-bridge-token-2024`
- Test with: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer devops-mcp-bridge-token-2024" http://127.0.0.1:4319/api/mcp/self-status`

### 3. Dependencies
- `yq` is ALREADY INSTALLED at `/opt/homebrew/bin/yq`
- All other dependencies are installed
- The server is built and running

### 4. Stage 1 Completion Evidence

#### OpenAPI Contract (v1.1.0) ✅
- Version confirmed at 1.1.0 in `docs/openapi.yaml`
- Discovery endpoints working:
  - `/api/obs/discovery/openapi`
  - `/api/discovery/openapi`
  - `/openapi.yaml`

#### Schema Versioning (obs.v1) ✅
- All endpoints return `schema_version: obs.v1`
- All 11 schemas have `$id` fields
- Run `node scripts/schema-lint.mjs` to verify

#### Observability Routes ✅
- All `/api/obs/*` aliases implemented
- Documented in OpenAPI spec

#### CI/CD Gates ✅
- Workflows in `.github/workflows/`:
  - `openapi-lint.yml`
  - `schema-lint.yml`
  - `validate-endpoints.yml`
- Validation scripts in `scripts/`:
  - `schema-lint.mjs`
  - `validate-endpoints.mjs`
  - `mcp-smoke.sh`

## How to Verify

1. **Quick health check:**
```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer devops-mcp-bridge-token-2024" \
  http://127.0.0.1:4319/api/mcp/self-status | jq .schema_version
# Should output: "obs.v1"
```

2. **Run schema validation:**
```bash
node scripts/schema-lint.mjs
# Should output: "[schema-lint] OK (11 files)"
```

3. **Run smoke test (with correct ports):**
```bash
OBS_BRIDGE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7171 BRIDGE_TOKEN=devops-mcp-bridge-token-2024 \
  ./scripts/mcp-smoke.sh
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **DO NOT** try to start the server - it's already running
2. **DO NOT** try to install yq - it's already installed
3. **DO NOT** edit `.tmp/config.toml` - the server uses `~/.config/devops-mcp/config.toml`
4. **DO NOT** look for the MCP server in other directories - you're in it
5. **USE** port 7171 for the HTTP bridge, and 4319 for the MCP server

## Summary
Stage 1 is complete. The server is running, all endpoints are working, and all validation passes. You should focus on verification, not implementation.
